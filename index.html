		What you can do:
		</h1>
	<p>
		in order to keep yourself safe, try doing these things:
		</p>
	<p>
		-Cut down any power lines near you. Birds are constantly recharging on these power lines, however if you cut down all power lines near you, the birds will not be able to reach you.
		</p>
	<p>
		-Stay away from 5G. 5G radiation is used to pick up locations of all humans near the birds. Stay away from anyone who uses 5G, and wear a aluminium foil hat for extra protection.
		</p>
	<p>
		-Dont use any modern technology. If a phone is absolutely neccesary to you, use a flip-phone, or some other phone that is unable to access your location
		</p>
	<p>
		Remember: if a friend or family member dissagrees with you on this, it is already too late for them, and they have been infected.
